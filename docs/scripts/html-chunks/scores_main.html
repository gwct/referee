				<h1>Referee's scores</h1>
                    <p><strong>Referee's scores in output files will range from -2 to 91.</strong></p>

                    <p>Since Referee's score is <a href="calcs.html">a ratio of probabilities</a>, theoretically any score from -infinity to +infinity 
                        is possible. However, in practice scores tend to be limited to -300 to +300. Positive scores indicate support for the called 
                        reference base while negative scores indicate more support for some other base.</p>

                    <p>We cap Referee's scores from 0 to 90. This means that all sites that score negative are converted to a score of 0, and any sites
                        that score higher than 90 simply get a score of 90. This scaling is practical because it makes scores easily interpratable and
                        allows for the converstion to ASCII characters in the FASTQ output.</p>
                        
                    <p>However, here are several scenarios where the scoring calculation is impossible. We have reserved some scores for these situations.

                        <center><table class="pure-table pure-table-striped">
                            <thead><tr><th>Scenario</th><th>Score</th></tr></thead>
                            <tbody>
                                <tr><td>The sum of the genotype likelihoods that do not contain the reference base is 0</td> <td>91</td></tr>
                                <tr><td>The reference base is called as N</td> <td>-1</td></tr>
                                <tr><td>No reads mapped to this site</td> <td>-2</td></tr>
                            </tbody>
                        </table></center>
                    </p>

                    <p>For the case of the reference base being called as N, Referee can calculate the highest scoring base and report 
                        it with the <code>--correct</code> option.</p>

                    <h3>Referee's scores are not Phred-scaled error probabilities</h3>
                    <p>Rather, they are a <a href="calcs.html">a ratio of probabilities</a>. While Referee's scores are said to be Phred-like
                        because higher scores indicate more confidence in the called base, they do not represent a probability of error as traditional
                        Phred scores do, and as such they are scaled differently. 
                    </p>

                    <p>Put succinctly:</p>
                    <ul>A Phred score of 10 corresponds to a probability of error of 0.1.</ul>
                    <ul>A Referee score of 10 means that the called base is <span class="math inline">\(10^{10}\)</span> times more likely than another base.</ul>
