# These are the major changes and updates. For build specific changes (which are too numerous to document manually), check the commits on github.

# TODO:
1) Implement a check for headers in external genotype likelihood files such that if headers aren't present in the right order, the program exits and tells the user to add them.
2) Improve the multiprocessing procedure such that 1) the input file is read through only once and 2) duplicates of the input file are not created.

# DEVELOPMENT:


# CURRENT:
# Version 1.1.2: September 27, 2019
01) Added and error message when trying to read .gz compressed FASTA reference file.
02) Added maxmimum input file size of 100GB to input -gl files to prevent users from duplicating large files and having intractable run times.
03) Added the ref_split.sh helper script to aid users that need to split large BAM files by scaffold.
